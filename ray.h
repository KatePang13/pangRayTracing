/*
The one thing that all ray tracers have is a ray class and a computation of what color is seen along a ray.
 Letâ€™s think of a ray as a function P(t)=A+tb. Here P is a 3D position along a line in 3D. 
 A is the ray origin and b is the ray direction. The ray parameter t is a real number (double in the code). 
 Plug in a different t and P(t) moves the point along the ray. 
 Add in negative t values and you can go anywhere on the 3D line. 
 For positive t, you get only the parts in front of A, and this is what is often called a half-line or ray.
